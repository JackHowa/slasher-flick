# Slasher Flick 
Return the remaining elements of an array after chopping off n elements from the head.

The head means the beginning of the array, or the zeroth index.

## Solution 
I used slice to begin at the howMany point. In this way, I didn't really need to delete from the head, or start, of the array.
